# Social Engineering Attack

<div>
<h1>Brief Synopsis:</h1> 
<h2>I received a call from the manager of the hotel, stating that the new night shift auditer was contacted by the hotel brand's help desk to allow entry into the front desk computer to conduct updates. I promptly advised the manager to isolate the end point from the network than responded to the site, reviewed security camera footage, and made contact with the victim. I instructed the victim to write a chronological statement of events. [Victim's Statement - ]([https://github.com/SandMan52/Social-Engineering-Breech](https://github.com/SandMan52/Social-Engineering-Breech/blob/main/Victims%20Original%20Statement%20-%20Redacted.pdf)</h2>

<h2>Once the time-line of events had been established and verfied by the security camera footage with the victims written & verbal statements. I conducted in-depth research of tools used and the severity of the breech through system logs and obvious footprints left behind by the suspect. The first item I investigated was the obfuscation technique deployed by the suspect. The security camera footage was extremly blury, so I conducted a Google querry for posible matches and was able to locate the method of obfuscation used via a popular remote access tool called TeamViewer.</h2>

  <h2>The next step was to investigate the suspects steps through event logs, browser, and email history. I was able to confirm the attacker sent various docs to his email via the business's email. The suspect was able to obtain a customers card that was pre-filled out on an electronic document. The additonal victim was notified. I conducted email header analysis of the corespondance with little to know success. I promptly filed a IC3 complaint that did not materialized with any known results.

<h2>Additonally, there was no lateral movement, an offline antivirus scan was completed on the breached PC, and remedial cyber security awareness training was conducted with the staff. All parties that were indirectly compromised were notified before sginificant harm occured.</h2>
