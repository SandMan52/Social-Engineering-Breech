# Social Engineering Attack
<h1>This was one of the many incidents that I had the pleasure to respond, investigate, and remediate.</h1> 
<h2>Brief Synopsis: I received a call from the manager of the hotel, stating that the new night shift auditer was contacted by the hotel brand's help desk to allow entry into the front desk computer to conduct updates. I promptly advised the manager to isolate the end point from the network than responded to the site, reviewed security camera footage, and made contact with the victim. I instructed the victim to write a chronological statement of the events.- [Victim's Statement](https://github.com/SandMan52/Social-Engineering-Breech)</h2>

I conducted in-depth research of tools used and the severity of the breech through system logs and obvious footprints left behind by the suspect. Some of the  I was able to determine that a customers card was compromised in the process due to it being  . Notified additonal victim of situation. The IC3 complaint never materialized with any results that I was made aware of. Remedial cyber security and awareness training was conducted with the staff of that establishment. Additionally, all parties that were indirectly compromised were notified before sginificant harm occured.</h2>
