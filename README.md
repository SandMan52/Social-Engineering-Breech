# Social Engineering Attack
<h2>This was one of the many incidents that I had the pleasure to respond, investigate, and remediate. The IC3 complaint never materialized any results that I was made aware of. Remedial cyber security and awareness training was conducted with the staff of that hotel. Additionally, all parties that were indirectly compromised were notified before sginificant harm occured.</h2>
