# Social Engineering Attack

<h1>Brief Synopsis:</h1> 
<h2>I received a call from the manager of the hotel, stating that the new night shift auditer was contacted by the hotel brand's help desk to allow entry into the front desk computer to conduct updates. I promptly advised the manager to isolate the end point from the network than responded to the site, reviewed security camera footage, and made contact with the victim. I instructed the victim to write a chronological statement of events. [Victim's Statement - ]([https://github.com/SandMan52/Social-Engineering-Breech](https://github.com/SandMan52/Social-Engineering-Breech/blob/main/Victims%20Original%20Statement%20-%20Redacted.pdf)</h2>

<h2>Once the time-line of events had been established and verfied by the security camera footage with the victims written & verbal statements. I conducted in-depth research of tools used and the severity of the breech through system logs and obvious footprints left behind by the suspect. The first item I investigated was the obfuscation technique deployed by the suspect. The security camera footage was extremly blurry, so I conducted a Google querry for posible matches and was able to locate the technique through a popular remote access tool called TeamViewer.</h2>
